3.1
- TAB_SIZE and CACHE_SIZE are not variables but #defined words, meaning that 
the words are replaced buy its values so thus they are never stored as 
variables and does not exhibit temporal locality.

- Array references are spatial locality when array elements are accessed in 
succession. 

3.2
- We forgot to consider the nested "j-loop" when counting the incrementations.
c1t1: = 79
c2t1: = 39
c2t2: = 78 

4
- The obvious choice is the unified configuration. If "data-only" or "instruction-only" is used we will have 
to access the memory instead of the cache when accessing the one that is not stored in the cache. But if we
have the "unified" configuration we will only have to access memory when misses occur. The misses will occur
more frequent than the "*-only" configurations but we will still benefit from it.

- We misread the question and thought that we wanted to get as close to the budget roof as possible. The 
Correct answer is 466 kr that we get when using 128 sets and an associativity of 2.
